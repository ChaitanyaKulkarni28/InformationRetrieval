Information Retrieval Homework 1 : Tokenization and Stemming

-Download the Cranfield Text Collection
-Keep the Cranfield folder including the code files tokenizer.java and Stemmer.java file in one folder
-Open terminal and go the path where above all items are being kept

Note: Considering all files(Cranfield dataset folder, tokenizer.java and Stemmer.java) are in one folder following are the steps to execute code.

Steps to execute tokenizer.java

1) Compile Stemmer.java in the terminal with the command -> javac Stemmer.java
2) Compile tokenization.java with the command -> javac tokenizer.java
3) Run tokenization.java with the command -> java tokenizer Cranfield/

Last command is basically -> java tokenizer pathToCranfieldDataSetFolder
 
Thus the output of Problem 1 and Problem 2 both will be displayed simultaneously on terminal

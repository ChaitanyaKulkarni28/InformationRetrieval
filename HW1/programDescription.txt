Algorithms and Data Structure:
1. I have used HashMap to store token and its frequency. (Token as a key and frequency as a value)
2. Program reads all files and processes each line one by one.
3. Processing: Here all SGML tags, digits, special characters, possessives and multiple white spaces are removed and words with dash('-') are splitted up as 2 separate words.
4. Once processing is done on particular line, line is split based on spaces and each word is added into hash map if newly occured or its frequency is updated.
5. Now hash map is traversed to see number of tokens which occurs only once.
6. To get 30 most frequent words I am sorting hash map in descending order based on its value and then returning its top 30 elements.

Program design decisions for token creation:
1. All upper case characters are converted into lower case and lower case characters are kept as it is.
2. Words with dashes are separated into two like middle-class becomes middle class.
3. From all the possessives, apostrophe before 's' and 's' has been removed
4. If the word is abbreviated like U.S.A the dots are removed (USA)
5. All SGML tags, extra spaces, digits and special characters are removed as well 

Both the program together took a variable time to run between 2-3 sec
